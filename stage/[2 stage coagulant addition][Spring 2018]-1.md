## Abstract

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
Use full, complete sentences.

The ideas in the final sentece are key to your work this semester and is understandable.

Combine these four sections into one paragraph. An abstract needs to be cohesive and short/clear/concise. Keep it under 100 words. See the abstract description in the rubric.

**Up-to-date abstract:** In the past, AguaClara built a predictive model by studying the effect of humic acid, clay and PAC coagulant on flocculation. Based on the modelling result and the study of bonding mechanism, it was hypothesized that two-stage coagulant addition, namely a separate coagulant addition, would increase the particle removal efficiency  while maintaining the coagulant dosage. During the first stage, coagulant was added to offset the effect of humic acid in water, then the second stream of coagulant can aggregate clay. The nano-aggregate formed in the first stage and small particles join to form big flocs. Last semester, our group designed and fabricated the experimental apparatus. This semester, using the same apparatus, our group conducted experiment for both one stage and two stage coagulant addition to. Our group will keep generating experimental data to compare the efficiency of different coagulant addition method and try to close the debate of one stage versus two stage.

**Apr 2 updated abstract:**
Based on the modelling result and bonding mechanism of humic acid, clay and PAC coagulant, we hypothesized that two-stage coagulant addition, namely a separate coagulant addition, would increase the particle removal efficiency. The first addition of coagulant offset the effect of humic acid in water while the second stream of coagulant aggregated clay. Using the same apparatus fabricated from last semester, we conducted experiment for both one- and two-stage coagulant addition. By comparing the particle removal efficiency of different coagulant addition methods, we aim to close the debate of one stage versus two stage.



## Introduction
**the logic**: ~~first give the background of NOM effect on flocculation and point out the problem: NOM reduce flocculation efficiency. then explain why we want to study its effect-want to optimize operation condition. then discuss what we learned in the past research-mainly the model and its result. then develop the hypothesis-two stage can save coagulant. after that our experiment test the particle removal efficiency of both 1stage and 2stage addition. so that we can validate our hypothesis: whether 2stage is more efficient. then out line, in the following report we would break down our experiment, from theoretical basis to apparatus design, then experiment process, finally we would analyze the data we generate and offer some conclusion.~~

Flocculation is among the most applied processes for water and wastewater treatment. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the physical and chemical process in flocculation is critical to the optimization of water treatment process, and so a predictive model to describe the flocculation process is needed.**/(basic definition)** However, the model built in the past research of AguaClara only considered the presence of clay and coagulant in water, and failed to take natural organic matters (NOM) into consideration. Natural organic matters, NOMs, are matters composed of organic compounds from the remains and waste products of organisms such as plants and animals and are ubiquitous in the natural water system. NOMs can be generated within the water source through biological activities, or introduced to the water body via drainage within watersheds, including substances generated during the breakdown of terrestrial organisms (Hudson et al., 2007). The application of flocculation to remove NOM from drinking water supplies is efficient, and helps avoiding the formation of disinfection by products (DBPs).[2](Mika et al.,2018) For processes based on the use of chemicals (e.g. coagulation and oxidation) and materials (e.g. adsorption), the increasing concentrations of NOM require the use of more chemicals or materials (Xu et al., 2016a), which ultimately leads to the generation of more sludge or spent materials. Hence, the effect of NOM on flocculation is crucial in developing flocculation processes that optimize the operating conditions, including the amount of coagulants.**/(general incentives and problem of our research)**

In the past research, the original model that only takes coagulant and clay into account has been extended by considering the effect of NOM on flocculation. After studying the bonding mechanism between clay, humic acid (HA), and coagulant, it was found that smaller particles(e.g. humic acid, HA) move faster in the fluid than larger particles(e.g. clay). Thus, in synthetic water composed by clay, HA and coagulant, HA collides and attaches to coagulant before clay. Once the coagulant surface is occupied by HA, the coagulant performance decreases because the occupied surface cannot attach to clay or nano-aggregate. It was assumed less coagulant is needed when it is added separately, a so-called two-stage coagulant addition, meaning the coagulants are added at two different stages of the treatment process.**/(state our hypothesis)** During the first stage, the coagulant is added to offset the effect of humic acid in water; then in the second stage, the second stream of the remaining coagulant can aggregate clay, which joins the nano-aggregate formed in the first stage, and small particles to form big flocs. It was assumed that after the first stage, all coagulant would be coated by humic acid. Thus, the coagulant added in second stage can function simply as an agglomerant to achieve better performance in aggregation.**/(explain our hypothesis)** Furthermore, if the coagulant dosage can be guided by a predictive model, operating conditions of flocculation process can be optimized and coagulant can be used more efficiently. Since AguaClara is an engineering project team focuses on sustainable drinking water supply in developing region, cost is a main concern. Therefore, using less amount of total coagulants in a two-stage settings is beneficial that it reduces the operational cost of water treatment plants.**/(prospective contribution to AC team)**

In this report, findings in literature review and our group's previous work are discussed, and following that are the experiment design and apparatus set-up of our team in this semester.

## Literature Review and Previous Work
**logic**: ~~describe previous work first. in this part, talk about Yingda Du's thesis and our report after that. then is the lit review, lit review should be organized in the following fashion:1.why we do this 2. what did other researcher do 3.~~

### Previous Work of AguaClara Project Team
The research of Yingda Du, a previous graduate student on the project team, explored the effects of NOM on flocculation. Her thesis (Du, 2017) determined the effects of humic acid on the particle size distribution of flocs and settled effluent turbidity for a synthetic surface water treated with polyaluminum chloride (PACl) as coagulant. The results from this thesis showed that presence of NOM increased the concentration of flocs and shifted the particle size distribution toward smaller particle sizes with a concurrent increase in the effluent turbidity. A mechanistically based hydraulic flocculation model, which took effects of humic acids into account, was developed in this research based on the observations of residual turbidity. The model was validated by successfully predicting data from independent experiments. The predictive model provided a useful guideline for effective coagulant dosages in water treatment.

Our research was based on her study of bonding mechanism between different particles in water. There are three different kinds of particle in our research model, they are clay, humic acid and coagulant nanoparticle. As it was shown in Figure 2, there are six kind of possible collision. However, only collisions with coagulant invoved can occur in reality, because clay and humic acid are not sticky, they can not attach to each other or themselves.

### Previous Work of Two-Stage Coagulant Addition Subteam
In Fall 2017 semester, TSCA (two-stage coagulant addition) subteam built the theoretical basis for future work by studying research report of previous particle removal research teams in AguaClara and relevant literature online. TSCA subteam built their apparatus based on the design of Contact Chamber subteam. Compared with the previous group*  , the set-up includes five pumps to achieve a precise control on fluid flow rate. Two down-flow contact chambers were applied in series before fluid enters the flocculator. The contact chambers created a space for particle collision to take place. The apparatus set-up of Spring 2018 semester was based on the previous design and the detail will be explained in depth in later chapters.

Studying the operation of ProCoDA software was another critical task the subteam accomplished in Fall 2017 semester. ProCoDA, a process control software software, allows the user to control many parts of the experimental apparatus and to automate data collection. Specifically, ProCoDA can control the speed of peristaltic pumps, regulate flow through solenoid valves, and measure water quality parameters such as turbidity by connecting to the turbidity meter. Automated data acquisition can record the speed of pump, turbidity of water, mass of container to an Excel spreadsheet directly. The resulting data was analyzed with Excel and Python codes. Using the increment function built in ProCoDA enable the team to conduct series of control experiments without staying in the lab. More detail of our experiment will be discussed in Method section of our report.**/(processing)** The original MathCAD base code used to calculate coagulant dosage, the composition of clay-HA mixture and pump speed was translated to Python codes, the code is attached after the main text.

According to the generated data, two stage coagulant addition need more time to form floc blanket than one stage addition. But in several trials with relatively low turbidity, one stage addition can not form floc blanket while the two stage addition could under the same condition.



### Literature Review

### Using PACl as neutralizer and destabilizer
Coagulation is one of the most effective methods to remove fine substances from water. Polyaluminum Chloride (PAC) was chose to be the coagulants of our research, because of its wide range of targets, low sensitivity of temperature and low residual metal-ion concentration. The effect of PACl in removing humic acid was significantly efficient comparing to other chemicals. (Sudoh et. al., 2015) Projects have a preference on PAC also because of the economic facter(i.e. low cost and high availability in both solid and liquid form). (Bratby,2006)

Generally coagulants function as neutralizer and destabilizer in the particle removal process. As it shows in Figure 2, originally, the negatively charged solids particles repel each other. As positively-charged coagulant is added to the mixture, they adhere to the negatively charged colloids, neutralizing the charge and destabilizing the particles. With the removal of charge, the destabilized colloids can now adhere to each other, forming microflocs.

</div>

### Effectiveness of Two-Stage Coagulant Addition
Based on Du's Thesis, the presence of humic acid as NOM affects the use of PACl as a coagulant for synthetic surface water, but in a one-stage setting, meaning the coagulant is added at once. Last semester, our model considered the attachment efficiency for the hydraulic flocculation. However, past studies have investigated the difference of efficiency of two-stage coagulant addition, meaning adding the coagulants at two different points, comparing with one-stage. (Liu et. al., 2011) Keeping the total amount of coagulant at the same dosage, when partial amount was added half-way, it was found that two-stage can produce floc 1.5 times the floc size comparing with one-stage, which potentially made two-stage more efficient to one-stage. As the floc blanket was formed, the flocs were connected together to for larger adn more irregular structure, making two-stage addition more time-efficient than one-stage.

## Methods



### Experiment Process
HA was used as the representative NOM because it is the most commonly found form of NOM in our surroundings. Kaolin clay is used to represent the colloidal solids.

The concentration of humic acid was fixed while the influent turbidity and coagulant dosage were controlled variable. Thus, the effect of turbidity on particle removal efficiency and the optimal coagulant dosage were tested. Three different value of target influent turbidity were used of 50NTU, 100NTU and 150NTU respectively. The coagulant dosages were varied by the increment function built in ProCoDA. The increment function can increase the coagulant dosage stepwise. When the run time of current state reach the duration we set in ProCoDA the function will be triggered and increase the coagulant pump speed according to the setting. Details about ProCoDA set-up can be found after the main text.

First, a set of one-stage coagulant addition experiments was carried out to find the optimal dosage that could reduce the effluent turbidity of 3 NTU or less, which was a requirement of AguaClara filter system. During the one-stage experiments, the second coagulant pump was turned off. Then, the dosages used in the first set of experiments (one-stage addition) were divided into two parts, where we would find the optimal distribution, at a point where most of the coagulant from the first coagulant pump would be used to absorb the humic acid in the system, and coagulant added by the second pump would lower the turbidity to be able to attach every particle in the system to its surface. Therefore, a T-connection was installed between the two coagulant pumps. This helped to manage the amount of coagulant that was input into the system as the first pump would control the total amount of coagulant being put into the system. When the second coagulant pump was opened, it would be able to control how much coagulant would be used for the second dosage, drain directly from the first valve, so that a fixed dosage of the total amount of coagulant put in could be maintained. This helped to test whether or not having a second dosage of coagulant before the second contact chamber would make the experiment perform better than the total amount of coagulant dosage in one stage.*

I am having a hard time visualizing the T-connection between the coag pumps and the set-up in general. Do you have a photo of the set-up? I am not understanding the rationale about dosaging between the two-stages as described by the latter half of the paragraph.
</div>
### Experimental Apparatus Design
The design of apparatus was based on the research of our subteam last semester.

ProCoDA (Process Control and Data Acquisition) software was used to automate data collection and control the experimental apparatus. Two upflow contact chambers are set before the fluid enters the flocculator, so that the coagulants are allowed more time and space to collide with particles in water. During the first stage of addition, coagulants collide and then are covered by humic acid in the first contact chamber. Originally, the pump was designed to input the correct coagulant dosage before each contact chamber, allowing the two stage coagulant addition. But due to the limitation of ProCoDA, which can only control a maximum of two pumps at the same time, one of the two coagulant pumps had to be controlled manually. In order to achieve the effect of two-stage addition, under the modified design, the coagulant for the second pump was drained from the first coagulant pump. (more details followed)



<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
First sentence is a run-on. Do not include "should" in that sentence because there either are or are not.

### Experimental Apparatus

* Design (calculations, constraints)
The ProCoDA system can only control two pumps, and one of the coagulant pump had to be connected to the system, so we could not add humic acid and clay separately like some of other groups in the lab.

   </div>

The way in which the apparatus worked was the following. To start with, clay, humic acid and water were added according to the calculation, into a 10L stock tank with a stirrer. This stock tank was connected to the clay pump, the pump speed would be control by ProCoDA system to maintain a relatively fixed influent turbidity. After that, mixture of humic acid and clay went through the first turbidity meter and influent turbidity of the raw water is measured.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
"The way in which the apparatus worked was the following" is both an incomplete sentence and too fluffy. Instead say how the apparatus worked in that first sentence.What calculation?Do you mean stirrer?How did you determine the pump speed for the fixed turbidity?What was that turbidity?Can the results from one experiment with a certain fixed turbidity be generalize for many tubridity levels?Turbidimeters not turbidity TurbidimetersChoose between is and was - have to keep tenses consistent.
</div>

Following this, the first dosage of coagulant was added right before the mixture entered the first contact chamber so when it entered the first contact chamber, all of the particles were stuck one with each other.

The second stream of coagulant was pumped into the system after the first contact chamber if we were running a two staged addition experiment.
Initially, we designed a method depending on whether the experiment require the addition of the second coagulant dosage or not, a valve was put so that we could control the coagulant addition. However, it was discovered that better idea to do it in a different way: the valve was taken out and the first coagulant addition pump was connected to the second coagulant addition pump. In this way, if a one addition test was being carried out, the first pump would work providing the previously set coagulant amount. On the other hand, if a two stage test was being carried out, while the first pump was providing the same dosage as before, the second pump would subtract from that the amount required for the second dosage addition.

* Complications in construction
 It is kind of hard to make a perfect system without any leak, because many parts we used in apparatus fabrication is processed by ourself, for example the cut and the drilling, also the "tube stretch". So it required us to keep monitoring the behavior of our apparatus, and fix the problem whenever it occurs.

 <div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">

* Summary: After the study of last semester and this semester, we came up with this current design. Due to the limit bench area, there is a lot of simplification in our apparatus set-up, but it did reflect the nature of the AguaClara water treatment plant. The next step of our experiment apparatus improvement is to reduce simplification, and recalculation on the size of contact chamber is also required.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">

### Procedure
For one stage addition experiment, in every single circulation, the coag dosage is 1.1-2.6mg/L, which was increased 7 times by using the increment function, a function built in . Two more data point was added on the basis of past experiment, one between 1-1.5mg/L, and the other between 1.5-2.0mg/L, because it was found that desirable effluent turbidity usually generated around that range of coagulant concentration. Besides, according to the previous data, 0.5mg/L and 1mg/L coagulant is insufficient to effectively reduce the turbidity of the synthetic water.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">

</div>

We are planning to run 3 circulations per week, which will take 3 days, and we will use different humic acid between those 3 different trials within a week. Thus we can test the impact of both humic acid and coagulant dosage on the flocculating process.

We will carry on series of control experiment for 2 stages addition, and find the most effective portion of coagulant allocation. Then we will compare with data generated from 1 stage experiment.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">

It is unclear to me what past teams have done and what you are doing.
</div>

Two-stage coagulant addition experiment should base on the data we generate with one stage addition experiment, the total amount coag addition can be the least dosage which can achieve the effluent requirement, and then we add two more circulations for comparison, vary the total amount, +-0.5 on the basis of the first trial. During those weeks we conduct two stages addition, we won’t test the effect of humic acid on flocculation because the mechanism of this part should be similar between one and two stage.

## Results and Analysis
### Impact of humic acid on flocculation
 Early in the spring semester, the experiment data of one stage addition experiments didn't align with our expectation and experimental results in the past. Our expectation was that the floc blanket could be found in our sedimentation tank each time we ran because the minimum coagulant dosage we used at that time was 1.5mg/L, which is enough to reduce the effluent turbidity to 15 or less according to the past research. Besides, the ultimate goal of our flocclation and sedimentation system is reducing the water turidity to 5NTU or less, so that the water can be treated by AguaClara filtration system. Based on the past research, the AguaClara filtration system can not effectively treat water with 5NTU or higher turbidity. In some of our trials, the effluent turbidity was range from 70NTU to 80NTU, which suggested that only the tube flocculator contributed to the particle removal. Several possible causes of the failure was raised, and following paragraphs will discuss how we tested them.

 One assumption was that due to the limit time of data acquisition state(detail explaination of ProCoDA set points can be found after the main text), the system did not have enough time to form the floc blanket. We extend the duration of data acquisition state, from 3600 seconds to 4800 seconds, and finally it was 8000 seconds. According to our observation, dense floc blanket usually formed one hour after the coagulant was added. If there was no floc blanket formed within two hours in a trial, it won't form over time.


 As we can see, the effluent turbidiy did not vary a lot even though the increment function worked, after examining the data we found that the coagulant pump actually worked around its lowest speed, and the past research showed that our pump did not work well at that speed. Therefore, for future experiments, we are going to set a higher intercept for the increment function, so the lowest rpm in our experiment now is 39.

### Impact of surface charge
Due to the limit port in our hardware, our group had to mix the clay and humic acid before pumped them into water. This set-up can have two possible outcomes. If the clay can cover by the humic acid when stirring in the stock tank, there should be a suspension which is easier to remove, because the amount of humic acid is reduced. But according to our observation, suspension with humic acid was harder to be removed than the single clay turbid solution. So here comes the second hypothesis. Both clay and humic acid is negatively charged, while humic acid has a higher charge density. The charge density of clay particles increase after attached by humic acid and they will become more repulsive to each other, thus the clay suspension is more dispersed and harder to be removed. According to our observations, suspension with humic acid did require more coagulant to be removed when compared with single clay suspension.


### Impact of coagulant dosage
Regarding the effect of coagulants dosage, determining the optimal amount is crutial. Overdosing the coagulant would result in a substantial increase in the amount of generated sludge and a decrease in pH, while a lower dose is generally the cause for the residual metal remaining in treated water(Ibrahim and Aziz, 2014).

#### Analysis of One Stage Coagulant addition
A primary concern was the lack of consistency in the formation of a floc blanket in our Sedtank during 1 Stage addition. It was concluded that due the limitations of ProCoDA, it constrained our team to mix clay and humic acid before it enters into the system. We hypothesis that due the prior mixing, ~~the humic acid makes the surfaces of the clay more negatively charged.~~ This disperses the clay particles more thus creating more clay particle surface area. This means that there is more clay than there is coagulant available to bind together and create flocs.~~In order to determine whether this hypothesis is true, we have modified our calculations and ratio of humic acid.~~




<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
I get that pump speed is an issue here but I don't know why. What determined the rpms of your pumps? Why is 20 NTU a bad result?

This sections needs much more development and polishing.

## Conclusions

At this point, we fully understood the ProCoDA system and could use the increment function to carry on set of control experiments with fixed turbidity and different coagulant dosage. Also we had implemented an electronic balance which also connects to the ProCoDA system to track the mass change of coagulant over time. It could offer us data to confirm our ProCoDA code will guide the pump to add coagulant to the amount we calculate.

Generally, we deduced that by using the current design of system, when the turbidity is relatively low, we will need more coagulant to reach the target effluent turbidity. In this experiment, our target effluent turbidity should be no more than 3 NTU, which is already expected with the standard Aguaclara system.

The calculation of coagulant dosage and the component of clay-humic acid mixture could be done on python now, we transfered the original MathCAD base code and translated it into python.

In the rest semester, we would keep running both one stage and two stage experiment.

If we validate our 2 stage hypothesis, we could use this model to guide the dosage in water treatment plant and save the coagulant, cut down the operational cost.

## Future Work
The current apparatus design is proved to be deficient by the contact chamber group because those two up-flow contact chambers we applied can't function as what they designed to be. Experiments demonstrated that the current design of contact chamber could not necessarily reduce the wall loss of the coagulant and improve the particle removal efficiency. Although right now we only use the contact chamber as a place for particle collision and divide the first and second stage addition physically, it would aid the improvement of particle removal efficiency if in the future we can modify the design of contact chamber. At present, AguaClara is using a tube contact chamber because this design can be easily fabricated by cutting a PVC tube. If not changing the design, we can test the effect of contact chamber with different length and diameter.  

In the current research of us and other particle removal research teams, the effect of pH has not been considered. However, pH could be the single most crucial factor affecting the effectiveness of metal-based coagulants(Qin et al., 2006). In the future research, pH has to be measured during the experiment. Both pH meter or pH test paper can be the option. In either water treatment plant or apparatus in the lab, pH can be adjusted by applying different chemical reagent. The effect of pH can be studied by conducting a series of experiment with different pH. On the other hand, experiment process can simulate the environment of water treatment plant if we can keep the pH value align with the water in our plant.

The predictive floc model developed by AguaClara is based on the past apparatus set-up and experiment process. Without considering the presence of floc blanket and the use of new tube sedimentation tank, the model can not simulate the current experiment, and it modeling result deviates a lot from present experimental data. The ultimate goal of our group is to revise the model to make it well aligned with the experiment in the lab so that the up-to-date research findings can guide AguaClara water treatment plant.

## Experimental Methods
### Set-up
***attention：*** the content about experiment set-up is distributed to the fabriaction and experiment part.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
I don't understand the point of the attention section.
</div>

### Experiment
**Step 1.** Fill stock tanks. One stock tank should be filled with a diluted solution of PAC coagulant, and the other should have a mixture of water, clay, and humic acid. The concentration of solution depends on experiment objectives and can be calculated by using the chemical dosage calculation code below.


**Step 2.** Once the solution is prepared, open the water and wastewater valves, turn on turbidity meters, and let the apparatus completely filled with water, the experiment is now ready to run. Be sure to turn on the sludge pump, a 1L/s pump next to the effluent turbidimeter, to ensure that sludge is drained to the wastewater line.

**Step 3.** Check important set points in ProCoDA. Set target influent turbidity, duration of data acqusition state and flushing state.


**Step 4.** Open the ProCoDa software and turn the "operation state" from OFF to ON, to turn on the clay pump so the influent turbidimeter will soon reach the target influent turbidity. Once the influent turbidity fluctuate around the target influent turbidity, go back to ProCoDA and switch the state from "ON" to "Data acquisition state", the coagulant pump will be turned on. Then switch the operational mode from "Mannual" to "Auto Switch".

**Step 5.** The data acquisition state will go back and forth with the flush state, which is used to wash out the floc blanket. The data will be recorded on spreadsheet for further use.

**Step 6.** Once the the data collected, check the datalog and turn off ProCoDa. Proceed to the cleaning procedure when experimentation is finished.

</div>

### Cleaning Procedure
 Once the experiment is done, we want to completely wash out the apparatus so it will be ready for the next experiment.

**Step 1.** Turn off the clay and coagulant pump while let the tap water pump run at a relative high speed.

**Step 2.** Remove entire apparatus from wall (recirculator \& tube settler) and throughly wash it out, then reattach it back to the wall.

**Step 3.** Wash out the Flocculator by unplugging the connection between the the outflow tube from the influent turbidimeter and the flocculator, and plug in tubing from the nearby sink to wash out the flocculator. Make sure there is a bucket at the end of the flocculator that will collect the water.

**Step 4.** Clean the influent and effluent turbidimeter. Make sure to turn on the Bypass channel first! First, open the bypass valve. Second, pinch the black outflow tube.

**Step 5.** Remove and wash out the vials from both turbidimeters. Refill the vials with clean water, then put back into the turbidimeters. Use Kimtech wipes to clean the glass throughly.

<div class="alert alert-block alert-danger">
Do you mean kimtech wipes?
</div>

**Step 6.** Turn off water to the flocculator and detach the tubing. Hook up the influent turbidimeter back into flocculator then re-open the influent turbidimeter BUT keep the effluent turbidity meter closed. Turn on the water pump to clean out the influent turbidimeter as well as the flocculator.

**Step 7.** Pour out the coagulant reservoir into a different bucket and rinse reservoir with deionized water to make sure all residue is washed out. Take out the push pin then wash out the coagulant reservoir throughly. Replenish reservoir with 5L (or less) of deionized water. Use MathCAD to determine how much 70.9mg/L PAC coagulant needed to use to get the desired results for the experiment.

## Experimental Checklist
Before running the experiment, we check apparatus following steps below:

**Step 1.** Turn on the influent and effluent turbidity meter and check whether the inside glass container is clean;

**Step 2.** Before reassemble the turbidity meter again, we turn on only the water pump and let tap water run through the system to see if their is any leak in the system, especially near the turbidity meter, in case water would flow to interior of the meter and cause damage to the apparatus;

**Step 3.** Turn on all pumps and set them with a tiny RPM value, then check if pumps run in the right direction;

**Step 4.** go to the "edit rules" part of the ProCoDA, check the parameter of increment function, make sure those valve are set according to the calculation;

**Step 5.** The last step, turn to "operation" part of ProCoDA, start the system with "Data Acquisition States" and make sure states would switch between one another automatically.

## ProCoDA Method File

### States

**{OFF}** - Resting state of ProCoDA. All sensors, relays, and pumps are turned off.

**{ON}** - ON state of ProCoDa. All sensors, relays, and pumps are turned on.

**{Data Acquisition}** - State 3 of the experimental process where the coagulant pump is working and the increment function would increase its value each time when we switch to this state. The data acquisition state usually set to be 2 hours, which is enough for the floc blanket to form.

**{Flush}** - State 4 of the experimental process where the coagulant pump stop working, during this stage raw water would run through the system and flush out the floc blanket build in last data acquisition state, so that every data acquisition state would run with same original system condition.


### Set Points

**{Turb target}** - The value of our target influent turbidity, ProCoDA will control the clay pump to maintain the target influent turbidity.

**{pump control(clay)}** - Use this set point to decide which pump should we control.

**{Flush Time}** - Duration of the flush state.

**{Data Acquisition Time}** - Duration of the data acquisition state.

**{State to Increment}** - Tell the increment function when to increase its value, in this experiment, we use increment function to control coagulant pump speed.

**{Slope}** - The slope of increment function.

**{Intercept}** - The intercept of increment function.

**{Max x}** - How many time would the increment function work during one circulation.

**{coag pump control}** - Use this set poiont to decide which coagulant pump should we control.

**{coag pump property}** - Flow rate per revolution.

**{balance}** - Variable with value returned by the electrical balance.
